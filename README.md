# Guess Who

The Guess Who program will allow you to participate in a guessing-game. Here you will guess the identity of the randomly chosen character. You will be given 8 chances to narrow down your potential person. 

Features to narrow down on include:
 - Hair color
 - Eye color
 - Skin tone
 - Male/Female
 - What they're wearing (i.e. glasses, hat)
